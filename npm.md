# NPM
## Node Package Manager

NPM is the default package manager for Node projects. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as initializing a new NPM project using `npm init`.  We can also install dependencies using `npm install`.  Additionally, npm can be used to automate some tasks by defining scripts that can be started using npm.  There are default scripts such as `npm start` and `npm test`.

When we install packages to our project, they will be stored in a folder called node_modules. NPM will automatically resolve subdependencies and install those, too. When you install a package, many new packages may appear in node_modules.
